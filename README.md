# RGS Blog - Things to Take a Loot At
This is a repository for the short blog that I wrote for the Royal Geographic Society (RGS).
These webmaps illustrate the volumes of active commute (i.e. cycling, running, and walking activities) between origins and destinations by small area units in Glasgow during 2015-2019.

The Strava dataset was provided the Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC) at the University of Glasgow.

## License
Due to Strava Metro's license, I am not able to share the data online. However, I will share my R codes on the repo.
